Have you ever wanted to look up a new recipe, but you find yourself parsing through a dissertation about how the spice of life is paprika and you realize that you're ten years older before you reach the actual recipe? Yes, the Internet makes me sad too.

I enjoy getting to the point about whatever technology I'm digging into, so you won't find the fluff here. Also, stop abusing paprika.
